# WORLD_EVENT.txt : Project 5 Description
# Priyanka Chandar: CPE 203-05
# Michelle Tan: CPE 203-01

Note: This is Priyanka's code base; however, emailing the respective files to each other made the program not function correctly, 
so I am submitting Project 5 on my repository if that is all right.

Include a text file named WORLD_EVENT.txt in your submission that describes:

1) how to trigger the event
2) what should happen when the event is triggered
3) what the affected entities should do
4) what the new entity is and how it should behave
5) (if applicable) the names of each partner and what each partner was responsible for


1) The event is triggered by clicking on the virtual world screen simulation that pops up. There are two clicks.
2) Click 1:
        Creates the background rainbow cross (ie. the world-changing event). It also changes miners into
        angel entities if within vicinity. If the cross is clicked/created upon a blacksmith entity, or other obstacles, the
        cross will overlay it/cover it up such that it will be as if it doesn't exist. More veins will also appear
        on random tiles of the virtual world.
   Click 2:
        Creates Devil entities.
   *On odd number clicks, whatever occurs in Click 1 will happen. On even number clicks, whatever occurs in Click 2 will happen.
3) Miners will become Angels. Angel entities will pick up ore faster than miners do. Angels will also hunt and
   kill the Devils once they appear.
4) The new entity is the Devil. As Devils are the enemies of the Angels,
   they work to help the Angel's enemy OreBlobs (ie. the enemy of my enemy is my friend).
   It acts in a manner similar to the OreBlobs, except faster/better at destroying veins.
5) Priyanka Chandar and Michelle Tan: We both worked on the project collaboratively over zoom.
   Michelle made the Angel class and Priyanka made the Devil class. We worked together on the virtual world implementations
   and the edits made to Background and Factory classes.
